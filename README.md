Politicians are corrupt. That's a fact. We show you WHO.


Aggregating 10 years worth of data, PoliPortfolio shows which politicians have used insider trading and government contracts to advance their personal gain. PoliPortfolio is NOT partisan. While we do indicate which party each elected official represents, we are not partisan but rather aim to expose the insider trading on the Hill that is hidden under thousands of pages of paperwork. After running through thousands of data points, the result is a website that displays politicians, their party, total transactions, and a "corruption score" out of 10. Users can also click on individual politicians to see more information like past transactions, return rates, and any significant trends.


The second part of PoliPortfolio displays a list of stocks that our algorithms have chosen based on politician trading. Since some politicians have more insider knowledge than others and therefore have higher returns of investment, we first attach a value from 0-1 on how effective they are at insider trading. Then, we sum up all stock purchases within the last month, weighting those with higher ROIs, to create a stock portfolio that we believe will do well. This portfolio is updated every 100 new trades. People can deselect or select politicians of preference.
